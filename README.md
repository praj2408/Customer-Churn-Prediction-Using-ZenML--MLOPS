# Customer-Churn-Prediction-Using-ZenML--MLOPS


Problem statement: For a given customer's historical data, we are asked to predict whether a customer will stop using a company's product or not. We will be using the Telco Customer Churn dataset for building an end to end production-grade machine learning system that can predict whether the customer will stay loyal or not. The dataset has 20 input features and a target variable for 7043 customers.

When someone leaves a company and when that customer stops paying a business for its services or products, we call that 'churn'. We can calculate a churn rate for a company by dividing the number of customers who churned by the total number of customers and then multiplying that number by 100 to reach a percentage value. If you want to learn more about customer churn, you can read this Wikipedia article.

To achieve this in a real-world scenario, we will be using ZenML to build a production-ready pipeline that predicts whether a customer will churn or not ahead of time. The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate how ZenML empowers your business to build and deploy machine learning pipelines in a multitude of ways:

- By offering you a framework or template to develop within.
- By integrating with popular and useful tools like Kubeflow, Seldon Core, facets, and more.
- By allowing you to build and deploy your machine learning pipelines easily using a modern MLOps framework.
